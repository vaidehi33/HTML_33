  <h4><u>Introduction to HTML</u></h4>
<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b>is the standard markup language<sup>[a]</sup> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<p><br>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<p><br>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by <i>tags</i>, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <b>&lt;img&gt;</b>  and <b> &lt;input&gt;</b> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;/p&gt;</b>surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
